Part 1 
Write a program to play the Hi-Lo guessing game.  In particular, your program should:
 
·         Generate a random number from 1 to 100.
·         Ask the user to guess the number
·         If the user is right, the game ends
·         If the user's guess is too high or too low, the program informs the user of that fact and asks for another guess.
·         This repeats until the user gets the number correct.
 
Further, your program should keep track of how many guesses the user takes to get the number right.  An appropriate insult/compliment should then be issued to the user.  For example:
        11 or more "What a terrible score!..."
        9-10       "Not too shabby, but not too good either...
        7-8        "That's pretty good but you can do better..."
        5-6        "That's a very good score..."
        0-4        "Amazing! Or was it luck?"
        
         
Part 2
Now implement a “high-score” record keeping system.  The idea is that each time you play (run the program), your name and score should be recorded in a “high-score” file (at least if you scored in the top ten).  At the start of each run, the game should list the top 10 best scores of anyone that has ever played your game.
 
Here is a sample run:
 
    Welcome to the number guessing game.  The top 10 best scores so far are:
        Ed Sheeran 4
        Camilla Cabello 4
        G Easy 5
        Robbie Schweller 6
        Lil Pump 7
        Post Malone 7
        Cardi B 9
        Dua Lipa 12
        Portugal Theman 20
        Demi Lovato 53
    Think you’ve got what it takes to make the top ten?  Let’s find out! 
    What is your name?
    Bebe Rexha
    Guess a number between 1 and 100
            (etc…)
    It took you 10 guesses Bebe Rexha!
    Not too shabby, but not too good either...
    Hey, you made the top 10!  Congratulations!
    (end program)
 
The next time the program is run, the following should be displayed.  Note that Bebe is now in the top 10, and Demi has been booted off.
