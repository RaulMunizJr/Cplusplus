Sorting Homework
 
Implement:
 
Selection sort or Bubble sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Quick sort
(bonus/optional) Radix sort
(bonus #2) Create a new sorting routine different from those above.  Implement and time your routine.  Are you able to beat the above methods?
 
Run each routine on the following test file containing 10 million 32-bit integers: numbers.txt
Write the sorted result to an output file call sortedNumbers.txt
 
Time each sort and include a write up showing the run times for each sort on the given data.  If you are using Visual Studio, it is important that you set your environment to run in “Release Mode”, not in “Debug Mode”.  Debug mode will run too slowly for this assignment.  You may explore online or in books how to implement each sort in the best possible way.  Be sure to cite your sources if you use ideas from some reference source.
 
Note:  be sure to use the “unsigned” integer type to store the input numbers.   This is needed as the input numbers are all positive numbers that may be up to a full 32 bits long.
